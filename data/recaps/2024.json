I haven't won yet. That's good, right? I got you all right where I want you.\nAt least with my current record, you guys won't have to stage another coup against me anytime soon. ;)\n\nAs usual, I'll not be proofreading all of this.

You've all heard that before.\nAlso, I'm thinking of slightly switching the format of the recaps. Instead of me breaking down each game, I think I'll just break down one game a week that I find the most interesting, with a possible honorable mention. Thoughts?\nI really enjoyed the video call with everyone on draft day. It was fun. And big thanks to Mikey for getting us the lake house. Hopefully next year, more of you can make it to draft in person. ",

It's almost like having the #1  pick this year was a curse (unless, of course, CMAC comes roaring back by like,  Week  8). Had I been at #2, I would've taken Bijan.\nNow, I have to face Bijan this  week  while CMAC is in Germany with some witch doctor (or whatever). I don't see me pulling this one out while Rachel has Bijan, Henry, Malik, and DK but we shall see. Maybe Hurts can bounce back against Tampa but maybe not.\nI have to mention another rivalry between Two Words and Rev. This one will likely be a bit lopsided (even though Crap Team just broke 163) but here's to hoping the upset can be pulled off. Or, you know, maybe both teams will lose.",
