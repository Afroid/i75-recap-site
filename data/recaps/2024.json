Rodgers has since then been warming up, which is likely part of Vu's success, averaging **18.09 per week** over the next two weeks. Looks like Rodgers is warming up as he continues to raise his points each week.\n\nKeep in mind, the Jets' D/ST (**-1.0**) didn't do Vu any favors either, though. That's brutal.\n\nSpeaking of underperforming **Week 1** players in this matchup, Drake London (**3.5**) nearly cost A Hall Lotta Love the game. Again, since Week 1, Drake has also been warming up and has averaged **18.05 per week** the last two weeks. Don't be surprised if he tries to trade London to one of us Falcons fans.",

Richardson was great in **Week 1 (26.08)** but has averaged **6.47 per week** since. Needless to say, that's tough for any manager.\n\nThere were really no holes in Two Words' team other than Aiyuk (**9.8**), who can't really seem to get going this year. San Fran had **288 passing yards** while Aiyuk could only reel in **48** of those yards. With Deebo being listed as **Doubtful** for Sunday, looks like even more pressure/coverage will be on Aiyuk.\n\nHowever, since Aiyuk was the only player without double digits for Crap Team (aside from the kicker), perhaps his team will be just fine.

Also, I'm having trouble publishing new changes again (which has been a pain, for whatever reason). So, bear with me but the site is coming soon. I know, I know. You've all heard that before.\nAlso, I'm thinking of slightly switching the format of the recaps. Instead of me breaking down each game, I think I'll just break down one game a week that I find the most interesting, with a possible honorable mention. Thoughts?\nI really enjoyed the video call with everyone on draft day. It was fun. And big thanks to Mikey for getting us the lake house. Hopefully next year, more of you can make it to draft in person. ",

Plus, I wanted to take Bijan in the draft but I thought the only logical thing to do was take CMAC. It's almost like having the #1  pick this year was a curse (unless, of course, CMAC comes roaring back by like, Week 8). Had I been at #2, I would've taken Bijan.\nNow, I have to face Bijan this week while CMAC is in Germany with some witch doctor (or whatever). I don't see me pulling this one out while Rachel has Bijan, Henry, Malik, and DK but we shall see. Maybe Hurts can bounce back against Tampa but maybe not.\nI have to mention another rivalry between Two Words and Rev. This one will likely be a bit lopsided (even though Crap Team just broke 163) but here's to hoping the upset can be pulled off. Or, you know, maybe both teams will lose.",
